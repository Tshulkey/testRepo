# Rooty-Tooty the Game

Explore the world of magic in a 2d side scrolling metroidvania esque map!

A 2d side scroller where players go from point A to point B using magic to defeat enemies while avoiding terrain hazards and enemy attacks. Players can upgrade their character with weapons (wands and staves) and new abilities such as more jumps and specials (summoning). Players can also find collectable currency scattered across the map to spend on upgrades.

- w/spacebar: jump
- a: left
- d: right
- s: crouch/fall through platforms
- aim with the mouse and right click to use magic
